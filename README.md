The Aglorithms, That's am going to cover in this project, I have studied from **Predictive Analytics and Data Minig Book by: Vijay Kotu. 
** 1.1 WHAT DATA MINING IS **
Data mining, in simple terms, is finding useful patterns in the data. Being a
buzzword, there are a wide variety of definitions and criteria for data mining.
Data mining is also referred to as knowledge discovery, machine learning, and
predictive analytics.
** 1.2 WHAT DATA MINING IS NOT **
While data mining covers a wide set of techniques, applications, and disciplines,
not all analytical and discovery methods are considered data mining
processes. Data mining is usually applied, though not limited to, large data
sets. Data mining also goes through a defined process of exploration, preprocessing,
modeling, evaluation, and knowledge extraction. Here are some commonly
used data discovery techniques that are not considered data mining,
even if they operate on large data sets:
Descriptive statistics: Computing mean, standard deviation, and other
descriptive statistics quantify the aggregate structure of a data set. This is
essential information to understand any data set, but calculating these
statistics is not considered a data mining technique. However, they are
used in the exploration stage of the data mining process.
Exploratory visualization: The process of expressing data in visual
coordinates enables users to find patterns and relationships in the data
and comprehend large data sets. Similar to descriptive statistics, they are
integral in the preprocessing and postprocessing steps in data mining.
Also Dimensional slicing, and Hypothesis testing.
** Types of Data Mining **

I will try to explain each algorthim in my repo while am applying it to my project.
** Project Case: **
Predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant using some classification Algorithms.
This Project will contain two phases:
** Phase one **
I will use RapidMiner 
** Phase Two **
I will use Python.
